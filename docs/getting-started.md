# Getting Started

This guide walks you through deploying the STACKIT Landing Zone from scratch.

---

## Prerequisites

- A **STACKIT organization** with your user account registered
- **Owner permissions** on the STACKIT organization
- **STACKIT CLI** installed ([Installation guide](https://github.com/stackitcloud/stackit-cli/blob/main/INSTALLATION.md))
- **OpenTofu** (>= 1.10) or **Terraform** (>= 1.10) installed

---

## Deployment Flavours

Three ready-to-use configurations are provided in `src/config/`:

| Flavour | Config file | Description |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| **Standalone** | `standalone.tfvars` | Governance, management, devops, and public landing zones only. No network area or firewall. |
| **Hub-Spoke** | `hub-and-spoke.tfvars` | Adds a connectivity hub with a network area and DNS zones. Corporate landing zones connect via the network area. |
| **Hub-Spoke + Firewall** | `hub-and-spoke-firewall.tfvars` | Full hub-spoke topology with a pfSense firewall appliance on the WAN/LAN boundary. |

Choose the flavour that matches your requirements and adjust the corresponding `.tfvars` file before deployment. At a minimum, update `owner_email`, `organization_id`, `company_name`, and `company_code`.

---

## Step-by-Step Deployment

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/stackitcloud/stackit-landing-zone.git
cd stackit-landing-zone/src
```

### 2. Download the pfSense firewall image (Hub-Spoke + Firewall only)

If you are deploying the Hub-Spoke + Firewall flavour, download the pfSense image into the `src/` directory:

```bash
curl -o firewall-image.qcow2 https://pfsense.object.storage.eu01.onstackit.cloud/pfsense-ce-2.7.2-amd64-10-12-2024.qcow2
```

### 3. Authenticate with STACKIT

Log in interactively via browser:

```bash
stackit auth login
```

### 4. Create a temporary bootstrap project

A short-lived project is needed to create the initial service account for Terraform/OpenTofu authentication:

```bash
stackit project create tmp-bootstrap
```

Note the `project_id` from the output.

### 5. Create a bootstrap service account

```bash
stackit service-account create bootstrap-sa --project-id <PROJECT_ID>
```

Grant the service account **owner** permissions at the **organization level** so it can provision all resources:

```bash
stackit organization member add <ORGANIZATION_ID> --subject <SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL> --role organization.owner
```

### 6. Configure service account credentials

Create a service account key and configure it for the STACKIT Terraform provider. Set the following environment variables:

```bash
export STACKIT_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL=<SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL>
export STACKIT_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN=<SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN>
```

Refer to the [STACKIT Terraform provider documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/stackitcloud/stackit/latest/docs) for all supported authentication methods.

### 7. Configure variables

Copy and edit the `.tfvars` file matching your chosen deployment flavour:

```bash
cp config/standalone.tfvars terraform.tfvars
```

Update the values to match your organization. Required variables:

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `owner_email` | Technical owner email registered in STACKIT |
| `company_name` | Company name for folder naming |
| `company_code` | Short prefix for resource naming (e.g. `exc`) |
| `organization_id` | Root organization container ID |

### 8. Initialize OpenTofu/Terraform

Comment out or remove the `backend "s3"` block in `backend.tf` for the initial run (state will be stored locally):

```bash
tofu init
```

### 9. Deploy the landing zone

```bash
tofu apply -var-file=config/<flavour>.tfvars
```

Replace `<flavour>` with `standalone`, `hub-and-spoke`, or `hub-and-spoke-firewall`.

Review the plan and confirm with `yes`.

## Migrating State to the Created Backend

After the first successful apply, the management module has created an S3 bucket for remote state and a service account for ongoing automation. Migrate to this backend to enable team collaboration and state locking.

### 10. Enable the S3 backend

Uncomment the `backend "s3"` block in `backend.tf` and update the `bucket` name to match the Terraform output (format: `<company_code>-pltfm-mgmt-prod-tfstate`). Configure the bucket credentials from the Secrets Manager in the management project:

```hcl
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket = "<company_code>-pltfm-mgmt-prod-tfstate"
    endpoints = {
      s3 = "https://object.storage.eu01.onstackit.cloud"
    }
    key                         = "terraform.tfstate"
    region                      = "eu01"
    skip_credentials_validation = true
    skip_region_validation      = true
    skip_requesting_account_id  = true
    skip_s3_checksum            = true
  }
}
```

Set the S3 backend credentials (retrieved from the Secrets Manager instance in the management project):

```bash
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<BUCKET_ACCESS_KEY>
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<BUCKET_SECRET_KEY>
```

### 11. Migrate state

```bash
tofu init -migrate-state
```

Confirm the migration when prompted.

### 12. Switch to the management service account

Replace the bootstrap credentials with the service account created by the management module. The service account email is available in the Terraform outputs. Retrieve its credentials from the Secrets Manager instance in the management project.

Update the environment variables:

```bash
export STACKIT_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL=<MANAGEMENT_SA_EMAIL>
export STACKIT_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN=<MANAGEMENT_SA_TOKEN>
```

### 13. Verify the migration

Run a plan to confirm no changes are detected:

```bash
tofu plan -var-file=config/<flavour>.tfvars
```

The output should show `No changes. Your infrastructure matches the configuration.`

---

## Cleanup

### 14. Delete the bootstrap project

The temporary bootstrap project is no longer needed:

```bash
stackit project delete <BOOTSTRAP_PROJECT_ID>
```

---

## Post-Deployment (Optional)

### Configure pfSense firewall

If you deployed the Hub-Spoke + Firewall flavour, configure the pfSense appliance as described in the [STACKIT pfSense documentation](https://docs.stackit.cloud/products/quick-deployments/pfsense-firewall/tutorials/configure-pfsense/).
